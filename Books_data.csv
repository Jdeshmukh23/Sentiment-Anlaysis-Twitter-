If she didn't, then who did, and will the actual murderer be found out and caught? Did the murder of the beautiful, golden tressed nun and a boy's apparent suicide ten years earlier tie in with the more recent murders? What is the spirit in the Monastery trying to say?

Suspense full of twists that keeps the intensity level high through the story.<br />Seth and Tonya both have some serious issues to be dealt with.

Tonya, don't only have a stalker ex-boyfriend, who had been in prison for trying to kill her before, her other boyfriend had died in a bullfighting accident.<br />So the road ahead of them wasn't easy, but the attraction they feel for each other is strong, and the connection they have go deeper than an attraction, they have respect, protectiveness, and kindness towards each other, they have lots of things in common, and they work together as a seamless team.

US,Clinical Anesthesia Fundamentals: Print + Ebook with Multimedia,1,5,5,"0 	(N)",Excellent lecture videos!,"Many folks commented on the TEXT of the book. As a medical student, I concur with the other reviews that this is an excellent introductory resource to obtain foundation for your clinical education.<br /><br />This review will instead focus on the lecture videos, which supplement each and every chapter, and can be easily overlooked - and let me tell you, they are great! As someone with experience in designing and producing interactive educational multimedia, here are my takes on the videos:<br /><br />- There is a video lecture that supplements each chapter. They are very nice summaries and place emphasis on the important points in the text while supplementing with interesting points to enhance memorization<br />- There are multiple choice questions immbedded between sections of each lecture, which are great reminders and pointers of key learning points and forced you to think again. Each question comes with a full explanation of choices and main concept.<br />- The videos are short and sweet<br />- They have very similar content to the text, but uses different sensory modalities (i.e. graphs, animations, images, audio) that enhance memorization; for example, for the introductory lecture on the history of anesthesia, the pictures of different historic figures and instruments really helped me link names to events.<br />- As someone with experience in designing and producing educational multimedia projects, I understand how hard it is to have high quality (and actually very useful) digital contents made available to supplement the text. There are inherent restrictions on the different technical parameters allowed by such web contents, such as the definitions and smoothness of the videos. With that in mind, the qualities of the lecture videos are pretty great. The other thing is, while you can switch the slides and lecturer windows, it might be helpful to have an option to change the sizes of different windows (I personally think the lecturer's window is too small).<br/>- I could recommend several good ways to utilize the lecture videos. 1. you can watch the videos after reading the text 2. you can watch the video first, and then you can pause and refer back to the text for clarification if needed - the videos cover the main points. 3. read the text of every chapter, then when reviewing the concepts at the end of your study, use the lecture videos.<br /><br />In summary, great videos! And if you bought this book or planning on getting this book (yes you will like it if you are a medical student learning anesthesia or a resident looking to lay down good foundational knowledge), make sure you USE these wonderful interactive digital contents!",31-08-2015,Monday,August,2015,hardcover_book

US,The Mind (Salmon Poetry),1,1,1,"0 	(N)",One of the finest voices in poetry you might not have heard about yet.,"If I were still working with John FitzGerald (in the interest of full disclosure, we worked together at Red Hen Press), I would nudge him and say of his book THE MIND, &#34;Skynet becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th.&#34; My sense of John is that he has been aware of himself for a long time, but not in a solipsistic or narcissistic way at all. He is a keen observer, a consumer of origins, fine distinctions, continua, grand schemes, and minute details. He likely began observing and contemplating information from the moment he experienced the glare of light in the delivery room, and he has never stopped. Interestingly, while THE MIND is about the remarkable way John thinks, it speaks to the larger questions of how we all think, how we came to be sapient in the first place, and how we develop as thinking souls in space and time. Keeping the language of his prose-like tercets basic, unadorned, and free-flowing, he accomplishes poetry of significance and elemental beauty. Left brain contemplation of structure and systems aligns itself with right brain wonder and whimsy, but neither hemisphere dominates in the work, so the reader can only expect the unexpected. And the rewards are great: poems of curiosity, orientation with the universe, sorrow, finding center, and surprising hilarity. (Only John can make the idea of rocks funny.) If I were teaching from John's book, I would encourage poetry students to examine his masterful skill with personification. I would encourage philosophy students to wrestle with his experiences of phenomena. I would ask psychology and neuro-biology candidates to experience the brain from inside-out. I would ask physics students to explore how we process space and time in an era when such concepts are continually challenged and updated. I would ask divinity students to consider creation from the point of view of the created. THE MIND weighs so many approaches to thinking and being that you won't devour it in one or two sittings. Read it as you would the Book of Genesis, or Hawking, or an introduction to meditation. You will not think the same way ever again after reading it.",31-08-2015,Monday,August,2015,hardcover_book

So much for suspense. The best I could say about this book is that it is okay. Just barely. It's a long book -- unnecessarily long -- and when the author hasn't taken the trouble to craft her plot in a suspenseful way, there's not a lot there to make you want to turn the page. I have mixed feelings about her main character, who was supposed to have been a vibrant, energetic, assertive woman, yet became weak and submissive to her manipulative husband. It's hard for any reader to identiify with that. Additionally, the romance in the book isn't all that interesting -- just two people who are attracted to each other. No real getting-to-know-you development, no build-up of heat, no surprise, really. This 500-page book is really 250 pages too long and it all feels stretched out, with long sequences of unnecessary dialogue, superfluous scenes to establish things that already have been established, and so on. Can't help wondering what's going on with Nora Roberts these days. She's written a number of really good books, but her recent books seem like &#34;Nora Roberts diluted&#34;. So-so, at best. Maybe with so many books behind her, she's just burning out. As far as this one goes, I'm glad I got it from the library. If I had paid for it, I'd have been steamed.

They are either part of the publisher's marketing department, fanboys of the author, haven't actually read it, or are sleeping with the writer.<br /><br />The main character starts off as an annoying, immature, self centered little bore and rides that wave all the way through the book. Most of her background story seemed irrelevant, only occupying the pages for the author to pack additional thickness into the book's spine. There was so little development of the actual house itself or analysis of any of the events by the doctor leading the research study that it was laughable. The whole story seemed so rehashed of other haunted house works that it screamed &#34;been there, done that.&#34;<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT (not that it matters; hopefully you won't waste your time anyway)***<br />The only enjoyable part was the main character committing suicide on the second to last page of the book.

US,The Stuck with a Series Boxed Set #1 (The Stuck with a Series Boxed Sets),0,1,2,"1 	(Y)",Pretty Much a Hot Mess,"The prequel shows promise and led me into the first book which started off well. At least until the chapter when the body is discovered. Then the author seemed to loose focus. Sam's character suddenly reveled she has mob connections and we are introduced to a group of people called the Mom Squad. They somehow play a role in solving the mystery You are also introduced to Nick's crazy aunt which sets up the second book.<br /><br />In the second book the crazy aunt has a voodoo curse go wrong and everybody including the Sherriff is running around trying to undo the curse with more magic. Which by the way the author insists on misspelling. Some part of the story are humorous but it would have benefited from a good editor. Sam's character expresses interest in learning magic (my spelling not theirs) in this book.<br /><br />Now we hit the third book in which we again find Sam's Mom squad and now we find out that Sam is related to Santa Claus and the Grams character is dating father time. We also see the return of Magic in the form of the queen of the witches. So if Sam wanted to learn more about magic why didn't she just go to this witch she already knows?<br /><br />The authors seem to be addicted the unbelievable plot twist school of writing. They also like to change voices pretty much every chapter from Nick to Sam unless they don't. Kind of like the book I couldn't really find a pattern. They started out with a good premise and then seemed to say &#34;Oh well lets write this half stoned&#34;.<br /><br />Truthfully I would have given it two stars but, knowing what is involved in writing a book and given the fact it did hold my attention if only to find out what whacked out thing they would introduce next I gave it three.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good mystery this isn't it. If you are looking for a book that will keep you guessing if only as to what or who they will introduce next this would be a good choice.

US,Junk (The Bristol Collection Book 1),1,1,1,"1 	(Y)",5 stars for this story,"what can I say....another great story from Ms Myles.<br /><br />Working with hoarders is one my interest area and found working with these individuals truly rewarding. …so I have been waiting to read this book for some time and ordered it in advance….what a treat it was to find it in my kindle last weekend….*grin*<br />I also believe that there is a bit of hoarder in most of us (you should see my sewing room!) so reading the journey of Jasper and Lewis was certainly captivating for me.<br />Jasper’s story brought tears to my eyes at times and certainly filled me with empathy. Lewis’ ethical dilemma about his counter-transference experience was also very interesting and how he dealt with his struggle and guilt. But I also felt it was more than average counter-transference expereince as Lewis had a powerful crush on Lewis from his high school days. I really liked the way Josephine tactfully created Lewis’ profession so noone would be too caught up that a therapist was emotionally & sexually involved with a patient….well… Lewis was still Jasper’s therapist albeit an unregistered one but at least they took 6 month away from each other and then Lewis decided to study further (which would help him to understand more about the dynamics in a therapeutic relationship)…so I felt better as a professional…<br />I also liked the way Josephine added a little sexual intimacy without overwhelming Jasper and Lewis’ emotional journey…<br /><br />Lewis’s parents were simple adorable!!! They reminded of the previous owner of my home so I kept laughing whenever I visualised them walking around naked doing chores…bending around to pick up things…putting the baking tray into the oven…sitting around…hahahhaaaaa<br /><br />There were no perfect bodies with stunning features in this book , how refreshing is that! Jasper and Lewis were just everyday individuals dealing with life and desperately trying to resolve their personal issues.<br /><br />I think, Josephine wrote this story with a wonderful level of sensitiveness and empathy. Here is another writer pointing out that love is not just for the successful, and the beautiful but is for everyone no matter what….I love this concept in a book….whether one is living with an illness, or a disability, or in poverty with emotional, physical scars, there is still another out there who will think the world of that “one”…sephine wrote this story with a wonderful level of sensitiveness and empathy.

It's not easy to fit so much story, background, personality, passion and love in so few pages. Not only does Ms. Summers accomplish this, but she does so in spectacular fashion.<br /><br />Erin McDonald is getting through each day by putting on a happy face and acting as if she is suffering from a broken heart. For the love of god, 8 years has gone by. Is it going to stop hurting when she thinks of Jesse and how he left her behind? Probably not, especially now that he's back in town for a visit. Her body and heart seems to have forgotten that he's bad news and leads to nothing, but pain.<br /><br />Jesse Hackett has never regretted his decision to leave behind the country life for a successful career in the city. But, he's always been haunted by the loss of the love of his life. He's back in town for his mom's birthday and he wants nothing more than to rekindle the old flame. How to do that without breaking both of their hearts even more is the big question. He is only visiting and will be going back to his life in the city and he knows Erin would never follow him.<br /><br />This book is not short on heat and passion, that's for sure. The witty banter between Erin and her sister made me laugh out loud in more than one spot. Eden really is very good at sarcastic humor, which just happens to be my first language. The love between Jesse and Erin was bittersweet, yet fun to read. I highly recommend this book and any other Eden Summers story.

US,Shirley Jones: A Memoir,0,8,11,"1 	(Y)",A Big Disappointment,"I was disappointed in this book, almost from the first page. Shirley Jones was an actress that I admired from afar, until I read about her choices in life. To begin, the book isn't well-written. Jones frequently repeats herself, her sentence structure lacks clarity, and her use of personal pronouns is at times confusing. I could, however, forgive these distractions; after all, she's an actress and singer, not a writer. But she should have made use of a good editor or ghost writer. That said, what I found most unappealing were her vivid descriptions of her sexual mores and lascivious forays with Jack Cassidy, including a 3-way event. Not only does she make clear that Mister Cassidy was \\very well-endowed,\\"" but she also tells us that his son was even bigger. Cassidy, as everyone knew, was an unrelenting cheat and adulterer. But this didn't seem to bother Jones much. At least, not enough to stop loving him or to leave him for many years. The Jones-Cassidy family were dysfunction because, it seems, that neither Jones nor Cassidy did what caring parents are supposed to do. Near the end of the book, Jones repeatedly attempts to justify her marriage to Marty Ingels-as she has been doing for more than 30 years. Jones claims she loved Cassidy (and still does), and that she loves Ingels. Both men, as she describes them, have serious flaws that she excuses and forgives out of hand. Unfortunately, she isn't a very sophisticated women, coming from a small town in Pennsylvania. I know that \\""Tell All\\"" autobiographies sell books, but I think Jones discredits herself in this missive. An example of this is, at the end of the book, she proudly boasts (in some detail) of still masturbating regularly at 80 years of age. As Miss Jones warns the reader early in her book, she is not the quaint, innocent young lady she flawlessly portrayed in her early films. And that's just too bad!""",09-09-2013,Monday,September,2013,Digital_Ebook_Purchase

US,Very Bad Things ( Briarwood Academy Book 1),1,28,36,"0 	(N)","Holy Hotness, Blasphemy, & Desires Ilsa!","Another Fave of 2013 &lt;3 &lt;3<br /><br />I've been totally drawn to this story since the day I watched the trailer, and the freaking gorgeous cover also had me gaga for this book. So, once I finally had it at my wee little fingertips, I DEVOURED it. I could not stop reading, I needed to satiate my hunger for all things Nora Blakely....and Leo Tate too!<br /><br />Nora, Nora, Nora!!! Girl you've gone and rocked my world. I've never hoped for a character to come out on top, as I did Nora. She's the epitome of perfection, beauty, and brains. She has the world at her fingertips and little does she know it, men within arms reach. She may have been fed by the silver spoon, but it wasn't always skittles rainbows and fluffy unicorns. Nope! Life has been anything but wonderful for Nora. Basically she was thrown to the wolves....and by wolves I mean her wonderful family. They are wolves in sheep's clothing. Other than the wolves, I was completely intrigued with Nora's approach on life. She is ready to let go of the good girl persona, and step into the world of carelessness, fun, partying, and God knows what else. She may walk on the wild side, but sometimes life throws you a gazillion curve balls when you least expect it to....enter Leo Tate, Baby!<br /><br />Dear goodness, Leo had me wrapped around his pinky finger the moment he waltzed into my life. Not only does he have stunningly good looks, he has bad boy written all over him. So yeh he's super sexy!! And he also shines bright like a diamond, in my eyes. He is a bad boy in every which way, but holy hell he is also one of the kindest men on the planet. Oh did I mention he is also a freaking delicious Rocker Man?!?!?!?! Yeh, he is. He literally will boogie woogie his way into your heart. As much as he is kind and beautiful, he is totally off limits to any woman under the age 25....but little does he know, his world is gonna tilt on its axis when Nora Blakely, not so graciously, enters his life.<br /><br />I need more Sebastian's and Mila's in my life. These two are the very bestest friends ever ever ever!!! I loved them to pieces. They are the type of friends that would bend over backwards to fulfill any request to make Nora happy. They love her completely. They're her rock when she needs them, and they help keep her sane and somewhat smart when decision making. Seriously, Mila and Seb complete me. They helped Nora spread her wings, so she could to learn to fly!<br /><br />Wanna talk angst? Well ok. I didn't know what to expect in the angst dept., but damn it was off the charts. I kept waiting for it to stop. But it didn't, not once. The angst first begins the second Nora and Leo meet, and then it snowballs from there. Their sexual chemistry is angsty too.....hot damn!!! I could talk for days about the desires and want that was flaming, but it would get boring....so you just need to know it had me at hello! I loved every second of their angst/chemistry factor!<br /><br />Sooooo...I went into this book thinking things were going to be hunky-dory and all will be right in the world. Well I was in for a surprise. All my first thoughts about this book, flew out the window. They were then replaced with WTH?!?! moments, and swoony ones too! For this being a debut book by Author Ilsa Madden-Mills, she hit the ball out of the park! She wrote a story full of hope, dreams, love, heartache, and chances.

US,Masters at Arms (Introduction to the Rescue Me Saga),1,2,3,"1 	(Y)",Great introduction. Can't wait to read the series!,"I had a hard time figuring out how to write this review. I loved this book, but if you're looking to this book because it's a BDSM series, you'll be a little disappointed. Maybe. Well, I hope not. But let me explain. The author starts out the book telling you exactly what you're going to get. Backstory.<br /><br />You get the backstory for the main characters in a multi-book BDSM series (the Rescue Me series). There's not much sex in this book at all. A couple of steamy scenes that are tame from a BDSM point of view and one scene that is graphic that shows one of the characters forced into sexual slavery (so it's not at all sexy).<br /><br />That said, this book is fantastically written. The characters are amazing. I loved them all. The depth they show, the real, authentic feelings, and their actions all drew me in. I will be reading every book in this series because I am so invested in these characters now.<br /><br />So buy this book. Read it. Get to know Adam, Damien, and Marc. (Also Kayla and Savi.) And then buy the rest of the books in the series.",09-09-2013,Monday,September,2013,Digital_Ebook_Purchase
US,Winning the Boss's Heart (Entangled Indulgence),1,1,1,"0 	(N)",A Winning Proposition,"A temporary arrangement that blazes with heat from the very beginning. Mason is looking to refurbish this estate and move on. He needs an assistant for only 12 weeks so the job can be finished in time.<br /><br />Billie is looking for a temporary arrangement where she can make money to go to college. This job opportunity sounds almost perfect... until you factor in the chemistry they both feel.<br /><br />This story was heartwarming, sensual, and extremely sensitive to the topic of losing a child. Mason is the broken man - broken by the loss of his daughter and the dissolution of his first marriage. All he is interested in is working, keeping his mind busy so he does not have to think about his feelings, and being able to sleep at night. Although he keeps busy, his thoughts still plague him and sleep eludes him.<br /><br />Billie's influence on Mason is obvious from the very beginning of their strange arrangement. She is so full of love and empathy, she could rally anyone to happiness. I love how she handles Mason and brings him around kicking an screaming, so to speak, so he can face life, his feelings and finally become a worthy member of society.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic one day read full of entertainment. Tastefully sensual, this romantic story will leave you smiling.",09-09-2013,Monday,September,2013,Digital_Ebook_Purchase
US,Anywhere,1,0,0,"0 	(N)",Fall In Love With Anywhere,"I received this book in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />This book drew me in and kept me up Friday night. I read until I realized all of my kids had put themselves to bed. I tore through 51 percent of it that night. If Saturday and Sunday weren't so busy I would have finished it Saturday at least by lunch! But by 3pm Sunday I was finished.<br /><br />I love Skye, she's vulnerable and she may not know what she wants, but she does know what she doesn't want. She's a grownup who has never been on their own, not really.<br />I like the detailed best friendship she has with Paige as well as her relationship with her younger brother.<br />I also like the depth of Asher's character.<br />I absolutely loved the plot and the journey. Skye is a girl we all have inside. She's taking the 'what if's' out of the equation. Figuring out who she is and what she really wants. It is the bravest thing that a person can do.<br />All I can say after reading it really is BRAVO!! j. meyers officially made me want to give a book a standing ovation! My brain echoed with the John Hughes-ish clapping to thundering applause.<br /><br />If you want to laugh and cry and laugh some more and swoon.....
