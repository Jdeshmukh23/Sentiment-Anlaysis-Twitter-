# Introduction :
* Sentiment Analysis is a process of "computationaly" determining the attitude of a peice of writing.That is, weather the text is possitive, negative, or neutral. It is also known as "Opinion Mining"
# Objective : 
* The objective of this project is to develop a python script that can input a perticular query from a user ( in this case - KL Rahul), foramt received tweets in unformatted plain text , remove any icons, remove redundant words, identify the sentiment of the users (positive, negative, neutral) towards this particular query, and then visualise it in a pie chart. A word cloud is also created to identify all the words that are most associated with this particular query.
* Note : To access tweets from twitter , you will need twitter API keys. To get those keys you will need to have a twitter developer account.  
# Use Cases :
* The term "Sentiment Analysis" is often used in the business world, especially in areas of data science and machine learning. Sentiment analysis is technique that can be used to assess the success of a company, to evaluate the present needs of the general public or a specific target audience, and to understand the stance of majority of the people regarding a particular topic.
* All of this can be achieved by doing a quick analysis on the various public posts of people with respect to the topic of interest. This can give us a great deal of information that can be used for further operations, improvements, and innovations.
